## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **Naive Bayes classification** to agricultural decision-making. Given soil nutrient data (N, P, K), pH, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall), our model predicts the optimal crop for those growing conditions.

### Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces the challenge of optimizing crop selection for varying conditions.  
Poor choices lead to:
- Reduced yields and economic losses
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Environmental degradation

### Solution

We apply probabilistic machine learning (Naive Bayes) to:
- Learn crop preferences from a dataset of soil and environmental features
- Predict optimal crops for new conditions
- Provide interpretable probability distributions
- Scale efficiently to large multi-crop datasets

### Hypothesis

**Naive Bayes can accurately predict optimal crop types based on soil and environmental features, providing a simple yet effective tool for agricultural decision-making.**

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Open `crop_rec_models.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Run all cells sequentially (`Cell > Run All`)
3. Review outputs and visualizations
4. Modify configuration parameters to experiment

### Configuration Options

The notebook includes configurable parameters for experimentation:

```python
# In the scaled implementation cells:
CROP_ROWS = {"rice": 50, "maize": 40, "chickpea": 35}  # Samples per crop
TRAIN_SPLIT = 0.70  # Training data percentage
SHOW_DETAILED_RESULTS = True  # Display prediction tables
RUN_SANITY_CHECKS = True  # Run diagnostic tests
```

### Example Prediction

```python
# Test conditions: high N, low P, medium K, cool temp, medium humidity, acidic pH, medium rainfall
test_conditions = {
    "N_bin": "high",
    "P_bin": "low", 
    "K_bin": "med",
    "temperature_bin": "cool",
    "humidity_bin": "med",
    "ph_bin": "acidic",
    "rainfall_bin": "med"
}

# Model predicts: Rice (97.8% probability)
```

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

**Feature Discretization**: Convert continuous features to categorical bins using tercile-based thresholds
- Nitrogen (N): low / med / high
- Phosphorus (P): low / med / high  
- Potassium (K): low / med / high
- Temperature: cool / temperate / warm
- Humidity: low / med / high
- pH: acidic / neutral / alkaline
- Rainfall: low / med / high

### 2. Naive Bayes Classification

**Mathematical Foundation** - Bayes' Theorem:

$$
P(\text{Crop} \mid \text{Conditions}) = \frac{P(\text{Conditions} \mid \text{Crop}) \times P(\text{Crop})}{P(\text{Conditions})}
$$

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. Calculate **priors**: $P(\text{Crop})$ from training data
2. Calculate **likelihoods**: $P(\text{Feature} \mid \text{Crop})$ for each feature
3. Compute **posteriors**: Multiply prior by all likelihoods
4. **Normalize**: Scale probabilities to sum to 1
5. **Predict**: Choose crop with highest posterior probability

### 3. Implementation Approaches

**Manual Computation** (Section 3)
- 15-sample dataset (9 rice, 6 maize)
- Hand-calculated priors, likelihoods, posteriors
- Educational demonstration of Bayesian inference

**Python Implementation** (Section 4)
- Programmatic calculation using pandas
- Modular functions for priors and conditionals
- Matches manual results for validation

**Scaled Implementation** (Sections 5-6)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (scikit-learn)
- Multi-crop support (3-22 crops)
- Cross-validation and diagnostics
- Handles continuous features without binning

## Key Findings

### Why Such High Accuracy?

Our diagnostic analysis revealed an important insight: **the dataset exhibits near-perfect feature separation**.

**Feature Separation Example - Potassium (K):**
- **Rice**: K ≈ 40 (±3)
- **Maize**: K ≈ 20 (±3)
- **Chickpea**: K ≈ 80 (±3)

With ~20-point gaps and only ~3-point standard deviations, there's essentially **zero overlap** between crops. This creates 5-6 sigma separation—crops occupy completely distinct regions in feature space.

### Real-World Implications

**Expected Performance with Real Data**: 70-85% accuracy (vs. our 98%+)

Real agricultural applications would face:
- Significant feature overlap between viable crops
- Measurement noise from soil testing
- Regional variations in optimal conditions
- Multiple crops viable for same conditions

### When Naive Bayes Works Well

- Features have distinct distributions per class  
- Feature independence assumption approximately holds  
- Large enough dataset for stable probability estimates  
- Computational efficiency matters  

### Limitations

- **Naive independence assumption**: Ignores feature correlations (temp × humidity)  
- **Zero-frequency problem**: Unseen combinations get zero probability  
- **Gaussian assumption**: May not hold for all features  
- **Linear boundaries**: Can't capture complex non-linear patterns  

### Critical Lesson

**High accuracy doesn't always indicate a sophisticated model**—it may simply reflect trivially separable data. Always validate that your model is solving a genuinely difficult problem through:
- Baseline comparisons (random guessing)
- Sanity checks (feature distribution analysis)
- Cross-validation
- Real-world testing
